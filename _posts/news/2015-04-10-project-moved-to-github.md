Google announced that [Google Code will be closed down on 2016][farewell-google-code], so **exceptions4c** has been moved to [GitHub][e4c-github]. This migration included:

 * [project page][e4c-gh-pages]
 * [repository][e4c-github]
 * [wiki][e4c-wiki]

Completing this migration tasks will take some work; so while I am on it, I am planning on **updating project documentation**. In addition, I will take advantage of [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] to **revamp the project page**.

Hopefully this migration will give a little push to the project.
